# Tutorial: patcher

This project provides tools to **compare** two pieces of text (like files) to find the differences (*diffing*).
It generates a structured list of changes called a **Patch**.
This *Patch* acts like instructions that can be used later by a **Patcher** to **apply** those changes to the original text, effectively transforming it into the new version, or reversing the changes.
It can handle changes across *multiple files* as well.


**Source Repository:** [None](None)
